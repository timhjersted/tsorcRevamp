⚠️ GAME MANUAL:
------------------------------------------
*Create a new classic character named Red Cloud (for multiplayer, everyone should use a different name)

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*The new dodge roll action with i-frames can be bound to any key in TModLoader's controller settings, under the mod section. (Left Alt by default. Left Shift is also recommended, with Auto Select bound to Left Alt.)

*In Bearer of the Curse Mode, your Estus Flask is bound to the Quick Heal key and the Cerulian Tear is tied to your Quick Mana key.

*Adventure Mode should stay checked in the TSORC mod config options to play with the custom story world.

*Multiplayer is supported for 4 players. Class diversity recommended. Post issues you find under #bug-reports. Thanks! 

*Go to #tips and #boss-list in our Discord for all game hints and walkthrough help


⚠️ PROJECT STATUS:
------------------------------------------
The game is fairly polished up to the end of the main story (defeating Attraidies). The post-Attraidies expansion (aka Super Hardmode) is fully playable but game balance is still WIP and not all bosses have been revamped.

Going forward, we'll continue to release occasional updates to address bugs and game feedback as our free time allows.

We're looking for new team members to help us, as our current team is often busy with work, college or other life things these days.

We still have big plans, but looking at it realistically, in the team's current state it's unlikely we'll ever reach 1.0, unless we can collect a few new team members willing to help us reach this (especially coders familiar with TML and GitHub). So if you want to see a full release become reality, come help us directly or spread the message to people who might be interested! Thanks!
