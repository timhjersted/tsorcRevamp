GAME MANUAL:
--------------------------------------------
*Create a new character named Red Cloud.

*Adventure Mode should stay checked in the TSORC mod config options to play with the custom map.

*Read signs in the order you come to them.

*Read all item tool-tips for hints and game clues, especially mod items.

*Don't move vanilla NPCs like the Wizard, Mechanic or Goblin Tinkerer until you've found them in game. Modded NPCs may be moved.

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*New dodge roll action with i-frames can be bound to any key in the mod's config options.

*Multiplayer is supported but we're still ironing out bugs. Post issues you find under #bug-reports. Thanks! The map supports up to 3 players. Class diversity recommended. Dark Souls will not drop on death in MP.
