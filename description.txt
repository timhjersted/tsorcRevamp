The Story of Red Cloud is a massive 20+ hour Dark Souls-inspired adventure built inside the world of Terraria using a custom map, mod and companion soundtrack.

In development over 7 years, your 1-4 player journey will span 18 dungeons spread across an expansive, hand-crafted open world filled with shortcuts, hidden paths, epic boss fights, and countless secrets.

⚠️ GAME MANUAL:
------------------------------------------
*Create a new classic character named Red Cloud (for multiplayer, everyone should use a different name)

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*The new dodge roll action with i-frames can be bound to any key in TModLoader's controller settings, under the mod section. (Left Alt by default. Left Shift is also recommended, with Auto Select bound to Left Alt.)

*In Bearer of the Curse Mode, your Estus Flask is bound to the Quick Heal key and the Cerulian Tear is tied to your Quick Mana key.

*Adventure Mode should stay checked in the TSORC mod config options to play with the custom story world.

*Multiplayer is supported for 4 players. Class diversity recommended. Post issues you find under #bug-reports. Thanks! 

*Go to #tips in our Discord for all game hints


⚠️ PROJECT STATUS:
------------------------------------------
The game is fairly polished up to the end of the main story (defeating Attraidies). We recommend waiting to play this third chapter when we're out of beta, unless you'd like to be a part of the journey to 1.0.

The new update has just gotten out of a long beta period, due to a slowdown in the mod's development. We decided to release the update because it should massively improve the experience, even though it might contain issues we haven't been able to spot yet. We'll likely release a few patches after this, to address upcoming issues and introduce a small amount of content that is not quite finished yet.

We're looking for new team members to help us, as we're struggling to find time to keep updating this mod.
We still have big plans, but looking at it realistically, in the team's current state it's unlikely we'll ever reach 1.0, unless we can collect a few new team members willing to help us reach this. So if you want to see a full release become reality, come help us directly or spread the message to people who might be interested!
