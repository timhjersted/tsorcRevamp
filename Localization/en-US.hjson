					2) Leave the world
					3) Rejoin the world with the character you want to have a restored minimap
					4) Delete this item and never use it again
					Warnings:
					This will only work for one character per world. Attempting to restore a second character's minimap will break the minimap of the first.
					This will reset your spawn to the world spawn next time you load the map. This is expected.
					This works by temporarily editing your World ID to trick Terraria into recognizing your old minimap as correct.
					This is completely unteseted with other mods. Tred very lightly.
					If you have entered other copies of the the custom map on this character since the update, there is a nonzero chance your minimap was overwritten
					If so it will not be recoverable.

					'''
					Are you the one I was sent to warn? My name is Jade, I am not of this world. I was sent here to warn you of the dangers posed by Attraidies, the Mindflayer King.
					He has grown mighty in power and seeks to destroy not only your world, but also mine and many others.
					'''
				HasShard:
					'''
					Is that a shard you've found? Here, let me see it.
					So that I may help you. To see light, to see hope. No matter how faint it might be
					'''
				RewardTip: Listen to everything I have to say and I may give you a reward.
				AttraidiesTip: Seek misery. For misery will lead you to greater, stronger souls. You will never defeat Attraidies with a soul so frail and palid.
				Tip1: Forge your souls in the flames of sacred altars and make their power your own.
				Tip2: If you ever chance upon a weapon befallen the terrible curse of poor craftsmanship, bring it to me and I shall bless it.
				Tip3: I hope you have a keen eye, for this is a land brimming with secrets...
				Tip4: The near-constant use of potions will prove vital on your journey, especially when attempting to retrieve lost souls.
				Tip5: A pickaxe or sticky bomb can be used to break blocks that are 1 width wide. Stone gates need switches to open. If in doubt, give it a whack.
				Tip6: Dark souls have special properties. On death, you will drop all your souls and have one chance to recover them. Die before this and they are gone for good.
				Tip7: On your journey you will encounter unlit bonfires, light them and enjoy the peaceful respite they provide. You can nuse them as checkpoints and storage.
				Tip8: You can stash excess ammo, weapons and armor in the safes and piggy banks found at save points and bonfires.
				Tip9: Stronger pickaxes can be used to open gates of strong ore.
				Tip10: And finally... I'm not sure what it means, but I was told to tell you to read something called 'The Game Manual' for more information. I get the feeling you know where to find it.
				ReceiveGift: Take this with you. May it ease your journey.
				Luck: Good luck.
				Gift: If you ever need more, you may roast some over the flames of a bonfire. Farewell.
				BotCGift: Bearer of the Curse, these lifegems and Starlight Shards will no doubt prove to be invaluable on your journey. Farewell.

					'''
					Red, it is as I feared. By killing Attraidies, a portal from
					the Abyss was opened, unleashing even more oppressive forces upon the world.
					The ancestors tell me that the portal can be closed, but
					you must first defeat the 3 Elemental Fiends: one of
					[c/2f8ee0:Water], one of [c/2d9e2b:Earth], and one of [c/f53d0a:Fire].
					You must also defeat 4 more lords of the Abyss:
					[c/ffbf00:Artorias], [c/00ffd4:Blight], [c/aa00ff:The Wyvern Mage Shadow], and [c/18ffe2:Seath the Scaleless].
					'''
				AdvModeSHMQuote2:
					'''
					My heart despairs for you, Red. It will not be easy. But if you succeed, you will have the strength
					to face the final lord, who has tended the flame of the Abyss since the world began.
					To the ancestors, he was known as [c/ff6618:Gwyn, Lord of Cinder].
					Gwyn's old tomb is buried somewhere beneath the Western sea, but he will surely kill you
					if you have not yet gathered the strength obtained from the other lords of the Abyss.
					'''
				AdvModeSHMQuote3:
					'''
					Have you seen the [c/ffbf00:Lihzahrd Gates] scattered across this world? They will lead you towards your goal.
					I would start with the one deep inside the Great Chasm, which leads to the Old One's Tree.
					There is another, to the East of Elengad's Desert Ruins. The rest, I'm sure you will find. The ancestors will help guide you.

				AdvModeSHMQuote4:
					'''
					There is one thing you should know about [c/ffbf00:Artorias], and another dark being that now stalks these lands,
					known as the [c/383838:Witchking].
					Both The Witchking and Artorias are protected by dark spells, making them practically invincible, but I have heard that
					[c/f53d0a:Fire Fiend Marilith] and certain [c/cffffa:Phantoms] that roam the skies are rumored to carry blades of fierce magic.
					[c/fcff00:The Barrow Blade] may just be strong enough to shatter their protection...
					'''
				AdvModeSHMQuote5: Good luck, Red.
				SandboxSHMQuote1:
					'''
					To close the seal to the Abyss, you must defeat the 6 lords of The Abyss:
					[c/ffbf00:Artorias], [c/00ffd4:The Blight], [c/aa00ff:The Wyvern Mage Shadow],
					[c/fcff00:Chaos], and [c/18ffe2:Seath the Scaleless].
					With a lord soul from each of these
					beings you will be able to summon the final lord -
					[c/ff6618:Gwyn, Lord of Cinder].
					'''
				SandboxSHMQuote2:
					'''
					To craft the summoning item for each
					lord, you will need to return to eight familiar places
					and collect a unique item from an enemy you will find there:
					[c/424bf5:The Western Ocean], [c/888888:The Underground], [c/b942f5:The Corruption],
					[c/42f56c:The Jungle], [c/6642f5:The Dungeon], [c/eb4034:The Underworld], and [c/42f2f5:The Eastern Ocean].
					'''
				SandboxSHMQuote3:
					'''
					Defeating [c/ffbf00:Artorias], however, will not be possible without a little knowledge.
					To find him, you must seek out the [c/383838:Witchking] and restore the strange ring he drops.
					He will sometimes appear at night, and more often deeper\nunderground, especially in dungeons.
					The most assured way to find him, however, is to enter the Abyss yourself using the Covanent of Artorias ring.
